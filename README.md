# Report to Customer Services - E-commerce
## This is the test automation framework based on Javascript, NodeJS, Jasmine and Selenium-Webdriver used to create tests easily for report sending validation.

This framework is made up of the following tools:
```
1. Javascript: The programing language to build the test logic.
2. NodeJS: The Runtime environment that allows packaging and manage the dependencies.
3. Jasmine: The testing framework that provides a BDD and easy-to-read syntax 
4. Selenium webdriver: Framework used to automate the actions in the browser and locate elements.
```

## Framework Structure
The relevant framework files are included in the "testing-framework" folder. The framework is based on Page Object model, so that inside the "testing-framework" folder there is a folder corresponding to each of the application pages (class folders) and additionally there is a folder (Components) that includes classes utilities, with specific functions that serve to build automated tests more easily. Finally it includes a folder to store the tests (Tests).
##

### In each folder corresponding to each page or view there are:
* A class of constants: which mainly includes the names, selectors and test data corresponding to that page.
* A class of POs (Pege Objects) or Elements: that includes the webEments of that page.
* A class of helpers or methods: that includes the specific methods of that page.

### Within testing-framework/components:
* Base page helper: Includes methods that are common to all classes (pages). All the helper classes, of all the pages of the application extend from this.

* Expectations helper: This class includes the main verifications in a generic way, using this class the specific verifications of each page are created.

* HTML helper: Includes HTML tags and attribute names.

* Logger helper: Includes the logger.

* Page helper: It contains specific methods that manipulate the page or the browser itself.

* test-suites Includes the tests to be executed

* Wait helper: Includes methods where expected.

### Within testing-framework/page-object/contact_page: 
* Includes methods, elements and properties of the page to be tested.

### Within testing-framework/tests:
* Includes the names of the different test suites to be executed.
